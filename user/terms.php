                <h4> Parking Subscription Promotional Offer Terms </h4>













                Novi will be automatically billing you as per Your Payment Method for each Subscription period on a monthly basis. However, if You change Your Subscription plan to a higher tier, this could result in changing the day on which You are billed and the amount which You are billed. Further, on changing your existing Subscription plan to another, you would be required to pay the difference in rates (on a pro rata basis) for the new Subscription plan selected and would be billed as per the new Subscription plan from the next billing / renewal cycle. Novi will notify you in advance of the change in the Subscription Fee payable. You cannot downgrade Your existing Subscription plan or any Add-on(s) prior to the expiry of such Subscription plan.

                <p>Novi will automatically start billing as per Your selected Payment Method for the relevant Subscription plan(s)
                     and any Add-on(s) selected by You at the time of registration through the third party payment gateway at the
                      end of the free trial period, if applicable unless You cancel a Subscription(s) before the end of the free
                       trial period. The cancellation of a Subscription can be done through the "My Account" section of the Site.
                        It may take a few days for Your payment made to Novi to be reflected in your "My Account" section.</p><br>

                <p>In case You cancel any Subscription before the end of the free trial period, You will not be entitled to any
                     compensation monetary or otherwise from Novi for the unutilized period of free trial.</p>

                <p>You cannot change your Payment Method during the tenure of your Subscription(s). If Your selected Payment Method is 
                    no longer available or expires or Your Payment Method fails for whatsoever reason, You will be responsible and
                    liable for any uncollected amounts and Novi reserves the right to terminate the Subscription(s) offered to You.</p>

                      and on each subsequent renewal automatically (as per the Subscription plan and the Add-on(s) chosen by You)
                unless and until You cancel Your Subscription(s) or the Subscription(s) is otherwise suspended or discontinued
                 pursuant to these Terms. To see the commencement date for Your next renewal period or to cancel Your subscription
